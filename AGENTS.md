# AGENTS.md

## Overview
- This repository is a GitHub profile README with embedded images and badges.
- There is no application code, build system, or runtime logic.

## Key directories
- `images/`: static assets referenced by `README.md` (PNG/JPG/GIF/SVG).

## Entry points
- `README.md`: main content rendered on the GitHub profile.

## Setup
- No setup required. No dependencies or environment variables.

## Run
- Not applicable (no runnable code).

## Lint/Format/Test
- No lint, format, or test tooling is present.

## Build/Deploy
- Not applicable; GitHub renders `README.md` directly.

## Data and schema
- None.

## Integrations
- External image/badge URLs and links are embedded in `README.md`.
- `images/` contains local assets used in the README.

## Conventions
- Keep assets in `images/` and reference them with relative paths in `README.md`.
- Prefer SVG/PNG for badges and icons to avoid large file sizes.

## Gotchas
- `Suri_Resume.pdf` exists at repo root but is a binary PDF (not referenced in `README.md`).
- Most images are binary assets; avoid editing them unless necessary.
